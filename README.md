# 100daysof..

### Code for at least an hour a day, share repos, record challenges to overcome them, and repeat the next day.

## About
As we all know Alexander Kallaway has been talking up the 100daysofcode, and recently I was reading his article about booting up your [New Year.](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.2sm9rwb5l) So I thought it would be a fun way to do a little bit more coding, as well as start blogging and tweeting about coding. Also checkout [Willcott321](https://github.com/Wilcott321/100DaysOfCode) repo for the challenge, Iâ€™ll be using a modified version of it for my challenges.
