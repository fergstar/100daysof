# 100daysof.. Löve2d
### Code for at least an hour a day, share repos, record challenges to overcome them, and repeat the next day.

## About
I've been playing aroudn with Löve2d on and off for a frew years now but never really doing anything awesome with it, so I use this to kick off my first 100 days.

## Specs
So for this 100 days of code I'm going to be working on learning [Löve2d](http://love2d.org) and a little bit of the Lua programming language as I go. For everyday I code, I will post, update and share a repo's of what I did that day.
