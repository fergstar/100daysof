# 100daysoflove..
### Code for at least an hour a day, share repos, record challenges to overcome them, and repeat the next day.

## About
I've been playing aroudn with Love2d on and off for a frew years now but never really doing anything awesome with it, so I use this to kick off my first 100 days.

## Specs
So for this 100 days of code I'm going to be working on learning [Love2d](http://love2d.org) and a little bit of the Lua programming language as I go. For everyday I code, I will post, update and share a repo's of what I did that day. 

## Log
### Day 1: 17th January, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the 100 days of code project folder. Started on a love2d tutorial [Part 1](http://www.osmstudios.com/tutorials/your-first-love2d-game-in-200-lines-part-1-of-3). 

**Thoughts**: Took a while setting up the project files and writing the readme files.

### Day 2: 18th January, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Installed Lua IDE '[ZeroBraneStudio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/)', also installed a Lua Package Manager called '[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/)'. Finished Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of the [OSM Studio tutorials](http://osmstudios.com/tutorials/your-first-love2d-game-in-200-lines-part-2-of-3). Started on 'bird' tutorial from [simplegametutorials](https://simplegametutorials.github.io/bird).

**Thoughts**: The IDE makes it easy to work with Lua and debugging. Finding some better tutorials to work thru.
